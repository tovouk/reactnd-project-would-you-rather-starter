# Would You Rather Project

This project is a web app that allows users to create polls, having two options to pick from, as well as vote on them. Upon voting, the poll will show its stats for each answer selected. There is also a leaderboard that shows how many answers and polls a user has.

A user must be logged in to interact with this webapp effectively.
